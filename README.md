Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of the app were to develop a fully functional app that collects weights and store them in a database. End goals for desired weights would be entered into the database and daily weights would show progress toward goal.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app were a registration screen, a login screen, a dashboard, and individualized screens to support each desired task. The UI designs keep user in mind by providing typography and colors that are soothing and pleasing. My designs were successful because I was able to develop the design scheme that was necessary to make the app appealing.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding by ensuring I knew the user requirements and needs. I ensured the app was user-friendly and was easy to  use as the user moves from screen to screen. These techniques or strategies appeared to be sufficient and I could use these same techniques in future apps. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested my code to ensure it was functional by building the app and running it using the emulator which simulates the app in use on a virtual device. This process is important because errors can be identified and corrected. The design of the app could be displayed on a virtual device to show ease of motion from screen to screen.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate to overcome the challenge of the emulator freezing my machine each time it ran. This would cause the laptop to be restarted, android studio restarted, the particular program restarted and another build process. I did a lot of research to determine the cause of the emulator problem. This included uninstalling and reinstalling android studio. While the program still persists, I will continue to troubleshoot it until it is resolved. After which, I will make an update to the readme file of the findings. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was able to demonstrate my knowledge, skills and experience while creating the UI interface diagram. It was the easiest part of the process for me because it required little effort. Once the first screen was created, it was easier to create the remaining screens and view them in design mode.
